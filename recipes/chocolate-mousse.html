    <p>This keto chocolate mousse is perfect when a sweet craving hits. It's so quick it will be ready in no time. No need to pre-whip the heavy cream — just throw everything into a bowl and mix! Use any keto-friendly granular sweetener that measures like sugar. I prefer the powdered version of Swerve, since it dissolves better. Adjust cocoa powder and sweetener amounts to suit your tastes. This is quite rich, so you don't need a lot to feel satisfied.</p>
